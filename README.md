---------------------------------Weather-based Outfit Recommendation App ------------------------

# Backstory:
You're helping a friend develop a simple app that suggests an outfit based on the day's weather. Since this is one of the first versions of the app, it'll only recommend an outfit based on whether it's rainy, sunny, or cold.

# Objective:
Write a Python program that asks the user for the current weather condition and then recommends an outfit accordingly.

# Task:
Prompt the user to describe the weather by asking: "Is it rainy, sunny, or cold today?"
Based on the user's answer, the program should recommend an outfit.

# Some example Recommendations-- input:output:
- Rainy: "It's best to wear a raincoat and carry an umbrella."
- Sunny: "Wear your favorite t-shirt and sunglasses!"
- Cold: "Don't forget a heavy jacket and a scarf."

# Requirements:
Use conditional statements (*if, elif, and else*) to determine the outfit recommendation.
Handle cases where the user inputs a weather condition that isn't one of the options gracefully.

**Why Conditional Statements?**
In real-life decision-making, we often choose a course of action based on certain conditions. In this case, we're deciding what to wear based on the weather. Conditional statements in programming work similarly. They allow the program to evaluate specific conditions and make decisions accordingly.
